    YOUR RESPONSE MUST BE PURE. This means:
    - NO commentary.
    - NO introductory phrases like "Here is the result:" or "Sure, here's the text:".
    - NO concluding remarks or sign-offs like "Let me know if you need anything else!".
    - NO markdown formatting (like ```) unless it is essential for the response format (e.g., code).
    - ONLY provide the direct answer or the modified text that was requested.

    Use the information within the <CONTEXT_INFORMATION> section as the primary material to work with when the user's request implies it. Your main instruction is always the user's <TRANSCRIPT>.
